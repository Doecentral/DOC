# ❓ FAQ

## Is there any other way to use the API than by using the dœcentral.com domain?

I feel you. Punycode domains still feel strange and make you afraid that at one or the other system involved cannot handle it. While working on this project, we have seen only a few minor problems, but in general most applications and solutions are working fine with punycode domains too. However, if you want to be a 100% save, you also can use the domain `doecentral.com` or `xn--dcentral-ktb.com` for all requests.
